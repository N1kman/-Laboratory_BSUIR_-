# -Laboratory_BSUIR_-

Here is the BSUIR laboratory work on the C++ programming language. 
The program includes work with the tourist, entrepreneur and businessman classes, which are connected hierarchically. 
To interact with these classes, a custom bidirectional queue container was developed. 
There is also an alternative in the form of an STL "set" container.

Developed by GILL NIKITA from VMSIS.
